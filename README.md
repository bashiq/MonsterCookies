# MonsterCookies
Craving cookies?  MonsterCookies is an ecommerce website in which consumers will be able to order freshly made cookies right to their doorsteps up until midnight. The user will have the options to choose from a variety of cookies and either get them delivered or pick them up at our convenient location at Capitol. 
With this project, I learned much about sessions, input type fields, and http requests.  We were taught these in class and I had to pretty much use all of them to build a proper site. Integrating the above allowed me to build the cart on my website and many other features. For example, most of the pages I used sent/received data via post requests since the data being submitted where values to beans and used to do some database queries. The do get method should only really be used for querying data. I also learned using a do get during a login is not a good idea since the username and password will be in the URL. I also implemented the MVC model which is essential to use since all the code is separated properly. This allowed me to organize my thoughts properly as well.
